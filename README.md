<h1>Machine Coding Problem</h2>
Create a button that when clicked, adds a progress bar onto the page. The progress bar would then fill up in a given amount of time (think 3 to 5 seconds). If you get past the first part, you will be asked to do throttling how many progress bars can be running at once. For example, if the limit is 3 progress bars, and the user clicks on the button 4 times, the fourth progress bar only starts after the very first one finishes.
